PROGRAMMING PROJECTS
Designing a Virtual Memory Manager
This project consists of writing a program that translates logical to physical address space of size 2^16 = 65,536 bytes. Your program will read from a file containing logical addresses and, using a TLB and a page table, will translate each logical address to its corresponding physical address, and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address.. Your learning goal is to use simulation to understand the steps involved in translating logical to physical addresses. This will include resolving page faults using demand paging, managing a TLB, and implementing a page-replacement algorithm.
